// Associative Arrays
// Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

// Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

// JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

// In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  

/**
 * If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object.
 * After that, some array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.
 * The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
// In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
// In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.
// Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

 * When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.
JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.

// JavaScript new Array()
// JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().
// But you can safely use [] instead.
// These two different statements both create a new empty array named points:
// const points = new Array();
// const points = [];
