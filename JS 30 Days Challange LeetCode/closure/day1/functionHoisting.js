/**
 * Function Hoisting
JavaScript has a feature called hoisting where a function can sometimes be used 
before it is initialized. You can only do this if you declare functions with the function syntax.
In this example, the function is returned before it is initialized. Although it is valid syntax, 
it is sometimes considered bad practice as it can reduce readability.

function createFunction() {
  return f;
  function f(a, b) {
    const sum = a + b;
    return sum;
  }
}
const f = createFunction();
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
