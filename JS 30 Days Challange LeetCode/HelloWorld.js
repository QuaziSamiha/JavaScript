/*
This code is written in JavaScript and it creates a function called `createHelloWorld` which returns another function. Let's break it down:

1. **`createHelloWorld` function**:
   - This function is declared using the `var` keyword, which is used to declare variables in JavaScript.
   - It doesn't take any parameters.
   - It returns another function.

2. **Inner function**:
   - The inner function returned by `createHelloWorld` takes any number of arguments using the rest parameter syntax `...args`, but it doesn't use these arguments.
   - It simply returns the string "Hello World".

3. **Variable declaration and assignment**:
   - `const f = createHelloWorld();` declares a constant variable `f` and assigns it the return value of `createHelloWorld`, which is a function.

4. **Function invocation**:
   - `f();` invokes the function stored in `f`. Since `f` holds the inner function returned by `createHelloWorld`, invoking `f()` returns "Hello World".

**Concepts used**:
- **Higher-order function**: `createHelloWorld` is a higher-order function because it returns another function.
- **Closure**: The inner function returned by `createHelloWorld` has access to the variables in its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This is a characteristic of closures in JavaScript.

**Time complexity**:
- The time complexity of invoking the `f()` function is O(1) because it doesn't depend on the size of any input.

**Space complexity**:
- The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it doesn't store any data structures whose size depends on the input size.

**JavaScript code concepts**:
- **Variable declaration**: Using `var` and `const` to declare variables.
- **Function declaration and invocation**: Defining functions using the `function` keyword and invoking them using `()`.
- **Rest parameter syntax**: `...args` is used to collect all arguments passed to a function into an array.
- **Arrow functions**: Although not used here, it's a common way to define functions in modern JavaScript. */
